Description: Whonix APT Repository Tool
 This tool can always be used to enable either Whonix's stable, testers or
 developers repository or to disable Whonix's repository.
 .
 Whonix's APT Repository is not enabled by default. Some users prefer this for
 trust/security reasons.
 .
 On first boot of Whonix, the Whonix Repository Tool gets automatically started
 by whonixsetup. The user is free to either leave Whonix's repository disabled
 or to configure it as desired.
 .
 Technically speaking, this tool creates or deletes
 /etc/sources.list.d/whonix.list and adds or deletes Whonix's signing key from
 apt-key.
